# Number-Guessing-Game_codealpha_task

To create a number guessing game, load the random library and set a number range (e.g., 1 to 100). Use srand to generate a random number within this range. Prompt the player to guess the number, and in a loop, compare their guess to the random number. Provide feedback: "Too high" if the guess is too high, "Too low" if it's too low. Continue until the player guesses correctly, then congratulate them with "Congratulations! You've guessed the number!" This loop ensures continuous feedback and interaction.
